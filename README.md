## About the Book
Natural language processing (NLP) is revolutionizing how machines understand and interact with human language, creating powerful applications from chatbots to text analytics. This provides a practical, hands-on approach to mastering these technologies, making complex NLP concepts accessible through step-by-step recipes and real-world examples.

This book walks you through the world of teaching computers to understand human language, starting with the basics and building up to advanced techniques. You will learn how to break down text into meaningful pieces, use Python programming to handle text data, and clean up messy text for analysis. The book shows you how computers can understand the meaning behind words using methods like word embeddings and BERT. You will discover how to identify parts of speech and recognize names of people and places in text, and how to sort text into different categories using ML. Advanced topics include finding hidden themes in document collections, building chatbots that can have conversations, and creating visual representations of text data. Throughout the book, practical Python examples help you implement these techniques while considering how to evaluate and deploy real-world NLP systems.

By the time you complete this book, you will possess the technical proficiency to implement complete NLP pipelines from preprocessing to deployment. The recipe-based approach ensures you can immediately apply these techniques to solve real business problems.

## What You Will Learn
